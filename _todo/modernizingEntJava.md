- Enterprise software development has always been one of the most exiting field of software development
- Enterprise world has been moving toward adopting cloud technologies (microservices, kubernetes, containers)
- Java and the frameworks and stacks built with it are often viewed as monolithic, and slow to start, consuming a lot of memory or disk space
- Quarkus, GraalVM, Eclipse Vert.x, Spring Boot, and OpneJDK allow Java developer to use their skills in Java for cloud technologies.

# Clouds
- Private cloud
- public cloud
- hybrid cloud
- multi cloud

# Cloud Native
- CNCF founded in 2015 and released kubernetes v1
- Bill Wilder used cloud native word first in his book "Cloud Architecture Patterns"

The CNCF defines “cloud native” as:
```
cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications
in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.
Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative
APIs exemplify this approach.
These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and
observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make highimpact
changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.
