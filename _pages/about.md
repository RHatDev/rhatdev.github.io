<b>Automating Resilience. Scaling Intelligence.</b><br/>
In the world of Tier-1 Finance, the goal is no longer just “digital transformation”—it is the creation of Self-Healing Infrastructure and Operationalized AI. My work at Red Hat focuses on deploying enterprise-grade solutions that allow FSI clients to automate at the speed of business while deploying AI that is secure, compliant, and impactful.

<b>Strategic Focus Areas</b>
1. <b>Intelligent Automation with AAP</b> <br/>I help financial institutions move beyond simple task-based scripts to Event-Driven Ansible and Ansible Lightspeed.<br/>
<b>AIOps & Self-Healing</b> Implementing Event-Driven Ansible to monitor FSI workloads (e.g., core banking, trading apps) and trigger automated remediation before outages occur.<br/>
<b>Compliance-as-Code</b> Leveraging AAP to automate regulatory audits (SEC, FINRA, GDPR), ensuring that every configuration change is tracked, signed, and compliant by default.<br/>
<b>Infrastructure for AI</b> Using Ansible to provision and manage the high-performance GPU clusters and specialized storage required for modern AI workloads.
2. <b>Operationalizing AI with RHOAI</b><br/>The challenge for banks isn’t just building models—it’s getting them into production safely. I specialize in Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) to streamline the MLOps lifecycle.<br/>
<b>Predictive Fraud Detection</b> Architecting scalable RHOAI pipelines to train and serve models that identify transactional anomalies in real-time.<br/>
<b>Private LLMs for Finance</b> Deploying secure, on-premise Large Language Models (LLMs) for internal use cases like automated ticket enrichment and customer sentiment analysis, ensuring sensitive financial data never leaves the firewall.<br/>
<b>Model Monitoring & Drift</b> Setting up RHOAI dashboards to monitor model performance and data drift, critical for maintaining regulatory model risk management (MRM) standards.

<b>The Architecture of Modern Banking</b>

The synergy between AAP and RHOAI creates a feedback loop:
* RHOAI provides the intelligence (e.g., predicting a hardware failure or identifying a surge in fraud).
* AAP provides the action (e.g., spinning up new clusters to handle load or quarantining a suspicious transaction).

<b>Selected FSI Engagements</b>

<b>Global Retail Bank</b><br/>Reduced Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) by 60% by integrating Event-Driven Ansible with RHOAI-based observability.

<b>Investment Firm</b><br/>Built a secure RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline on RHOAI for internal compliance researchers, reducing document review time by 40%.

<b>Payment Processor</b><br/>
Automated the deployment and day-2 operations of a multi-region OpenShift footprint using AAP, ensuring 99.999% uptime for core transaction engines.

I’m passionate about helping banks stop fighting fires and start innovating.</p>
