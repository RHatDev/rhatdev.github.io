**Welcome to RHatDev Blogs**

In the world of Tier-1 Finance, the goal is no longer just “digital transformation”. it is the creation of Self-Healing Infrastructure and Operationalized AI. 
My work at Red Hat focuses on deploying enterprise-grade solutions that allow FSI clients to automate at the speed of business while deploying AI that is secure, compliant, and impactful.

**Strategic Focus Areas**

* **Intelligent Automation with AAP**
    I help financial institutions move beyond simple task-based scripts to Event-Driven Ansible and Ansible Lightspeed.

*  **AIOps & Self-Healing** 
    Implementing Event-Driven Ansible to monitor FSI workloads (e.g., core banking, trading apps) and trigger automated remediation before outages occur.

*  **Compliance-as-Code**
    Leveraging AAP to automate regulatory audits (SEC, FINRA, GDPR), ensuring that every configuration change is tracked, signed, and compliant by default.

*  **Infrastructure for AI**
    Using Ansible to provision and manage the high-performance GPU clusters and specialized storage required for modern AI workloads.

* **Operationalizing AI with RHOAI**
    The challenge for banks isn’t just building models. it’s getting them into production safely. I specialize in Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) to streamline the MLOps lifecycle.

*  **Predictive Fraud Detection**
    Architecting scalable RHOAI pipelines to train and serve models that identify transactional anomalies in real-time.

*  **Private LLMs for Finance**
    Deploying secure, on-premise Large Language Models (LLMs) for internal use cases like automated ticket enrichment and customer sentiment analysis, ensuring sensitive financial data never leaves the firewall.

*  **Model Monitoring & Drift**
    Setting up RHOAI dashboards to monitor model performance and data drift, critical for maintaining regulatory model risk management (MRM) standards.

**The Architecture of Modern Banking**

The synergy between AAP and RHOAI creates a feedback loop:
* RHOAI provides the intelligence (e.g., predicting a hardware failure or identifying a surge in fraud).
* AAP provides the action (e.g., spinning up new clusters to handle load or quarantining a suspicious transaction).

**Selected FSI Engagements**

**Global Retail Bank**
Reduced Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) by 60% by integrating Event-Driven Ansible with RHOAI-based observability.

**Investment Firm** 
Built a secure RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline on RHOAI for internal compliance researchers, reducing document review time by 40%.

**Payment Processor**
Automated the deployment and day-2 operations of a multi-region OpenShift footprint using AAP, ensuring 99.999% uptime for core transaction engines.
